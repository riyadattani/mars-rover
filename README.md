# Mars Rover

This is a coding solution to the Mars Rover problem.

The problem: The rovers are to navigate around a plateau in Mars to send back pictures of the surrounding terrain back to Earth. A program needs to be built to control how the rover gets round the plateau.

This is a tech test provided by ThoughtWorks. See full task [here](TASK.md).
